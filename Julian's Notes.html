            </div>
            <div class = "Description">
                <p> HTML is a markup language which is a way of annotating a document to distinguish it from text. HTML can be composed of multiple different document types like text, images, hyperlinks and etc. More information can be found <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">here</a> </p>

                <b> HTML Tags and Elements </b>
            </div>
            <div class = "Description">
                <p> Tags and elements tell HTML how to format and show different text and images and it's what HTML is composed of. More information on the different tag types and what they do can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/"> here </a> </p>

                <b> Block text versus inline </b>
            </div>
            <div class = "Description">
                <p> Block type elements have to have a begin and an end and usually renders the text inside of a block seperate from the regular inline text, one example would be the bold element. Making sure to end your block is really important because it will continue to render the rest of the text in the block where you started the element. Inline elements can be used right in the middle of text and doesn't render the text to a block format, one example would be the line break element. </p>

                    CSS stands for cascading style sheets and it is used to add styles to HTML documents. For example if you wanted the text to render a certain color or text to be aligned differently then you would use CSS to do that.

                    A good coder optimizes their code so that when they want to implement something then it should be to avoid having to do the same thing over and over again. If something has to be changed for a certain feature but it is used a lot then you should redesign that feature to suit multiple things.
